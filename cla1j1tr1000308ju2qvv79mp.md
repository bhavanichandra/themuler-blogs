# MuleSoft Flex Gateway

## Introduction

- MuleSoft's Flex gateway is an ultrafast way to manage and secure API's running in a server / container with full capabilities offered by MuleSoft's API Manager.
- MuleSoft's API Manager provides an industry-leading way to manage API using policies. A policy can be applied to an API to manage its behavior without any code changes. These are applied at gateway level. 
- There are various policies provided by MuleSoft, such as
	- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
	- OAuth0 Authentication Policy
	- Client ID Enforcement. 
- And many other policies are supported by MuleSoft. Visit [MuleSoft docs](https://docs.mulesoft.com/gateway/1.1/policies-included-directory) to see the actual list of policies supported by flex gateway.

## Steps to use Flex Gateway

In this blog post, I'm going to demonstrate using a linux box I have. I have a simple User Management API developed in Python (Fast API).  API allows an Admin user to manage users, profiles and permissions. For this blog post, I choose the following policies, such as Logging Policy and Rate Limiting with SLA policy.

### Prerequisites:

The following prerequisites are needed,
- Anypoint Platform access. To try it, you can create a 30-day trial at [this](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/signup) page
- API you have developed in another language other than Mule
- Linux Server

### Install Flex Gateway
- In Runtime Manager, click on Flex Gateways in the side menu. 
- From there, click on Add Gateway button.
- Select Linux option and follow the steps mentioned there to install the flex gateway in a linux box.
-  Use below command to install **flex-gateway** to linux server

```bash
curl -XGET https://flex-packages.anypoint.mulesoft.com/ubuntu/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://flex-packages.anypoint.mulesoft.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mulesoft.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y flex-gateway
```
- Use below command to start the flex gateway

```bash
sudo systemctl start flex-gateway
```
- Once it's installed, execute below command to start the flex gateway, register it in Runtime Manager

```bash
sudo flexctl register <GatewayName> \
  --token=a8c34b42-a6be-4c82-92be-db7496983289 \
  --organization=0de7096a-6bf0-422c-a567-7450c69c0405 \
  --connected=true \
  --output-directory=/usr/local/share/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d
```
- You can also check the related services using the below command

```bash
sudo systemctl list-units flex-gateway*
```
### API Manager Configuration
* Once your application is deployed to your server, we need the implementation URL for the application
* Go to API Manager, and click on Add API button at the top of the page. Click on **Add New API**.

* In the Add API page, select the Flex gateway and select the gateway you have added above. Click Next to continue.

* In next page, you can either select API from exchange or create a new API. Give the appropriate name and asset type based on your API. For this blog, I selected HTTP API. I'm going to interface JSON Typicode API and managing it. Click Next to continue.

* In next page, you can add the endpoint details, base path and port. Click on Next to continue.

* Here, you can see the full summary of the flex gateway API configuration. After this, click on Save and Deploy API button below.

![API Manager 6.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667507060854/uFd-k-mLr.png align="center")

* API manager deploys the API to the flex gateway, and it will apply the API configuration to the flex gateway.

* In this article, I am going to apply two policies: Go to the policies page and select Rate-Limiting Policy.
* Rate-Limiting Policy: This policy is used to set a compliant limit on the API. Restrict unnecessary calls to API.
* Add the necessary configuration to enable the policy

* Next Select, Client ID Enforcement and select Basic Authentication as the credential origin.

* Now, to access the API, we need client ID and client secret. Go to the Exchange and click on **Request access** button. Follow through the creation process and get the tokens.

* Once you got the access, you can go to the server where flex gateway is created and use localhost to make API calls as shown below
  
![HTTP Call](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667507399036/W_urnyNYG.png align="center")

* In the above screenshot, 
	* First call is made to users/1 endpoint with client ID and Client Secret with Basic Authentication
	* Next Call is made with invalid Client Secret, which throws error out, as the client secret is wrong
	* In the Last call in this image shows that a call is made without basic authentication header.
* From these above calls, we can be sure that Client ID Enforcement is applied to the API.
* In the next HTTP call, I have called the API every second to trigger Rate-Limiting policy. You can see Too Many requests' response, which indicates the policy worked.
